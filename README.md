# TDD-By-Example--Fibonacci

This is a based example in Kent Beck - TDD By Example Book, Fibonacci Test.
Here, it was written using xUnit and .NET Core 2.

Instead of using for loop and an array to push test data,
Theory and InlineData attributes were used for this, provided by xUnit .NET

*Theories are tests which are only true for a particular set of data*
or in other words, *a set of InlineData* attributes
